## A Bad FE Boiler

This boiler is bad. Its only meant to give you some webpack and babel and hot reloading. It does not have a server. Adding a server to this would be annoying for you. So dont do it. Write your own application, webpack config, and babelrc if you want a server.

### Using
develop: `npm run start:dev`

test: `npm run test:dev`
